# Flat XO

A reimplementation of xo linter (https://github.com/xojs/xo) powered by a single eslint flat config.

## Status

This project is current work-in-progress. It had been previously paused due to performance and compatibility concerns due to the early stages of flat eslint configurations. However, at this time much of that has been smoothed out. ESLint 9 has been released so the completion of this effort is now a priority.
